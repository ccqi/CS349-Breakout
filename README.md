To run the code, call make run fps=[fps] speed=[speed]
Speed is a value between 1-5
Fps is a value between 25-144

In addition to regular breakout feature, I added some powerups, here's how they work
Each brick has a 1/5 change of containing a powerup
A brick drops a powerup when it is destroyed
The powerups are:
- Expand paddle
- Shrink paddle
- Acid Ball (ball goes through bricks)
Each powerup has a equal chance of occuring
